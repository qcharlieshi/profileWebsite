Created with Javascript ES6, Node, Express, Postgres and React

## My anatomy

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup. It'll create the database for you if it doesn't exist,
assuming you're using postgres.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts. (Right now it has *one* script that creates a useful symlink.)


## Quick Heroku deployment

1. Set up the Heroku command line tools
2. `heroku login`
3. Add a git remote for heroku:
  - **If you're creating a new app...**
    1. `heroku create` or `heroku create your-app-name` if you have a name in mind.
    2. `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to add postgres
    3. `npm run deploy-heroku`. This will create a new branch and compile and commit your
       frontend JS to it, then push that branch to Heroku.
    4. `heroku run db/seed` to seed the database

  - **If you already have a Heroku app...**
    1.  `heroku git:remote your-app-name` You'll need to be a collaborator on the app.

Afterwards,
  - *To deploy:* `npm run deploy-heroku`
  - *To re-seed:* `npm run db/seed`  # profileWebsite
