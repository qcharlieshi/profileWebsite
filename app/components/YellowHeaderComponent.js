          Hello, my name is <b>Charlie Shi</b> and Iâ€™m a software engineer that graduated
          from Emory University in 2013 with a finance degree. After spending some
          time in banking and consulting I made the decision to get back to my first love,
          software engineering, by taking the full-time web immersive program at Fullstack Academy.
          My current expertise lies in web development whether its creating a server to serve up a
          RESTful API or carefully crafting a beautiful component in React and CSS. I pride myself
          by having a mix of technical skill and creative ingenuity.
